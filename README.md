Realised with Fresh framework. You can follow the Fresh "Getting
Started" guide here: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

### Live demo 

I used the Deno Deploy (https://deno.com/deploy) to host the project, that's so easy.
